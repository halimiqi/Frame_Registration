According to the 2D images from MRI scan, the algorithm produces the 6 parameter of the transformation to get the new location of the robot's frame.![](https://github.com/halimiqi/Frame_Registration/blob/master/images/frame.png)![](https://github.com/halimiqi/Frame_Registration/blob/master/images/2Dimage.png)> the initial location of frame![](https://github.com/halimiqi/Frame_Registration/blob/master/images/frame2.png)![](https://github.com/halimiqi/Frame_Registration/blob/master/images/2Dimage2.png)> the location after transformation## 2 RequirementIf you want to use the GPU to train this algorithm,  an NVIDIA graphics card is required. Please make sure that you have  installed correct version CUDA and CuDNN.  ### 2.1 Python version- Python3### 2.2 Package Requirement - `Tensorflow-gpu  >  1.6` (using GPU and CPU) or `Tensorflow > 1.6`(only using CPU)- ` Numpy`- `Tensorboard`- `Tqdm`- `SimpleITK`## 3 Project Structure- networks  > this archive contains nerual networks with different stucture- play  > this archive contains the tensorboard files while run the networks has been trained- RawDataFullConnect  > the rawdata- save model   > this archive contains the parameters of a trained nerual network- tfboard  > this archive contains tensorboard files while training- config_full.py  > the overall configuration- GetMarkLocation.py  > preprocess the rawdata- Main_FullConnect.py  > main function of the projects## 4 Usage### 4.1 To Train The Networkset the variable`self.IsTraining = True` in the `config_full.py`run `Main_FullConnect.py`### 4.2 To Run A Trained Networkset the variable `self.IsTraining = True` in the `config_full.py`run`Main_FullConnect.py`the output is`pred.npy`. It is an 2D numpy array, the first axis is the index of the images,the second axis is the transformation. The format of the transformation is `[translationX(mm), translationY(mm), translationZ(mm), rotationX°,rotationY°, rotationZ°]`
